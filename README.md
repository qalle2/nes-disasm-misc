# nes-disasm-misc
Others' NES homebrew, disassembled by me.

* `bpm.asm`: *BPM - Nintendo's Beginnings* by retroadamshow
* `dvd.asm`: *DVD Screensaver for NES* by Johnybot

The `.asm` files can be assembled with [ASM6](https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/674/).

Run the `.sh` files (under Linux) to assemble and validate the programs.
